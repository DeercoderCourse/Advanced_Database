# Data Mining

## Statistic Modeling
Originally, “data mining” or “data dredging” was a derogatory term referring to attempts to extract information that was not supported by the data

Now, statisticians view data mining as the construction of a *statistical model*, that is, an underlying distribution from which the visible data is drawn

## Machine Learning
Machine-learning practitioners use the data as a training set, to train an algorithm of one of the many types used by machine-learning practitioners, such as Bayes nets, support-vector machines, decision trees, hidden Markov models, and many others

For some cases that we can describe the goals of mining more directly, machine learning approach is not a good idea
